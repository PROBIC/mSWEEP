# Sparse vector example 02

This example discusses serialization techniques for succinct vectors.

Example shows how to:

1. Simple serialization
2. Serialization/deserialization using serialization utility classes.
3. Deserialization into immutabele mode (to save more RAM)
4. Disable/enable XOR compression for serialization
