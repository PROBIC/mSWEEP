BitMagic Language mappings libraries.


This section provides BitMagic Library for C and Java JNI.

libbm - C language library
jni   - Java native interface mappings (experimental)


The build system is based on cmake. 
Currently we managed to build bmlib without C++ runtime dependency, which makes language bindings easier.

Linux build:

cd build
./cmake-gen.sh
make

cmake-geh.sh provides a default build instructions, please use it as a sample-template
to build AVX2 and SSE4.2 packages.
